							<h3>Fraud Investigation</h3>
							<p>My name is Mark Macapagal and I am an intern for IREA-- the Investigation, Revenue, and Enforcement Administration.  I work in the division of IREA called the Bureau of Fraud Investigation (or BFI).  BFI's goal is to prevent fraud and abuse of [the Human Resource Administration's] public benefits, meaning cash assistance, food stamps, and Medicaid.</p>
							
							<p>I intern for the Office of the Executive Director, and as such, my job and my supervisors' job, is to <span class="italic">solve all of BFI's problems.</span></p>
							
							<p>If that sounds a little vague, that's because everyday we faced diverse challenges: a new topic to research, a new policy to revise, or a new meeting to attend. The internship’s pace has been busy, but through strong collaboration with my supervisor and other managers, we deal with these issues.</p>

							<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
							<p>Some of the tasks I've had to complete over the course of my internship include:
								<ul>
									<li>revising the new procedure for MIIP (which is the Medicaid Integrity Investigations Program)</li>
									<li>writing a corrective action plan to fix improperly handled Food Stamp claims</li>
									<li>and proposing a new employee disciplinary action when we encountered a unique scenario.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							
							<p>If that sounds a bit boring, I swear it was a lot more fun because my supervisor was the best. Whenever we write something we'll sit at my desk, and she'll start talking, and I'll start typing, and we'll finish each others sentences, and it’s really cute.</p>

							<h3>Lifelong Business Lessons</h3>
							
							<p>Through the many policies and topics I've had to review, I've been exposed to the wide scope of IREA's operations.  I've also had to the chance to the sit in on meetings with managers, and learn what approaches are necessary to becoming a great leader.  Approaches, like encouraging bottom-up communication from workers to supervisors, rather maintaining an outdated top-down communication.</p>
							
							<p>Or I'd be reminded of the importance of simple things, like 'play nice', or meetings can get awkward really quickly.</p>

							<h3>Mental Health Awareness Training</h3>
							<p>Though I’ve had the chance to leave my mark on the IREA by writing policies that will outlast my time here, there was one project during this internship that I could really give my all to:</p>
							
							<p>I was highly involved in the development and research of mental health awareness training.  I’m a Neurobiology major and you might wonder, as I did early on, how I ended up as an intern for the Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  But with my background in psychology, I knew that this was “my calling”.</p>
							
							<p>To give a brief background, BFI was court ordered to train all its investigators on mental health awareness.  Sometimes, a client’s mental health can affect the proceedings of a case. For example, it’s difficult to prosecute someone in court if a psychiatrist claims they are clinically incapable of making good judgment.</p>

							<h3>Training is fun!</h3>
							
							<p>My supervisor, other BFI managers, and I met with a psychiatrist, and we thoroughly discussed different indicators of mental disorders. I made notes, compiled every managers’ concerns, did additional research about mental disorder symptoms, and about how police respond to certain scenarios.  I wrote the training materials, revised it and got it approved, <span class=italic">and finally</span>, helped deliver the mental health awareness training to every BFI investigator, including Supervisors and Deputy Assistant Directors.</p>
							
							<p>As an intern, training experienced employees, it was both an ironic and highly fulfilling experience.</p>

							<p>I never expected just how much I was going to encounter during my PSC internship, but I am so grateful for the opportunities I’ve had.  Thank you to Talako Wong, HRA, and every Public Service Corps employee that allowed me this chance.  The people I’ve met and the lessons I’ve learned will surely aid my future career, thank you. </p>
